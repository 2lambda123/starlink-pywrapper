List of known issues:
=======================


kappa.fitslist: not really useful at all for this program (it only
produces output to screen.)  The work around: read in the fits headers
manually, or use fitsval. (Note fitsval is super slow if you need many
headers, but fine if you only need one.)

cupid.findclumps: the RMS has a default value, but it won't accept it
except through the PROMPT, so it must be provided on the command line.

atools.astmask: the VALUE parameter has to be provided, even though it
claims it defaults to 'BAD' (similar to cupid.findclumps issue?)


kappa.stats: the values (like 'median') that aren't always generated
will be returned to the user from a *previous* run of the command if
they were ever created in that ADAM dir.
