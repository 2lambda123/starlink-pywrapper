This section shows you how to make a few plots using KAPPA, as either an XWindow which will pop up on your computer, as a PNG or as an EPS appropriate for conversion to PDF. These are then embedded in this jupyter notebook using the jupyter/ipython specific display commands.\n",

    "\n",
    "First of all we will set up a different KAPPA style file, so we don't get multicoloured lines on a black background. To set up sensible plotting defaults, we will create a  `kappa_style.def` file, following the instructions at http://www.starlink.ac.uk/docs/sun95.htx/sun95se7.html#x8-620003   We're going to use the shell command `echo` via the magic jupyter notebook commands accessed with `%`"
